\chapter[Low-Cost Robot Manipulator Arms]{Low-Cost Robot Manipulator Arms}\label{chap-lowcostarms}

The course Introduction to robots, focuses on robotic manipulators.  As a TA for this class, I designed a series of labs using a cheap (under US \$50) robot arm kit.

[INSERT A PICTUE OF THE ROBOT]

The kit, as purchased, is not a robot.  It is instead a device with five motors and the user has a small controller that can turn motors on and off.

My labs are arranged as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Lab 1:  open-loop control
\item  Lab 1:  open-loop control
\item  Lab 1:  open-loop control
\item  Lab 1:  open-loop control
\end{enumerate}



\section{Lab 1: Open loop control}

describe the lab, explain what worked well


\section{Lab 2: Open loop control}

describe the lab, explain what worked well

\section{Pre-semester prep}

What materials need to be ordered?  What needs to be set up?


\section{Results}

explain the outcome of the labs
