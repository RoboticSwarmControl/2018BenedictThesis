In the field of robotics, there are various control systems utilized depending on the kind of robot being considered. This project presents three different robotic manipulators, and then compares their control systems. The first system is a cryogenic cooled manipulation system. In this system, the robotic system implements 3-dimensional control on the robot’s position and orientation. To obtain accurate control without a solid Iron core, this system has all its coils cooled with liquid nitrogen drive more current into the coils without damaging them. The second system is created to test an algorithm for navigation in a cavity using global inputs, while taking advantage of the cavity’s geometry, and frictional wall contacts. The last system is a robotic manipulator created out of a toy robotic arm kit. The aim here was to increase the robot’s accuracy and augment its functionality, while making it user friendly to students new to robotics.
