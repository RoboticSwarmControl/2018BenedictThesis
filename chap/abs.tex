Miniature robots manipulated by external magnetic fields could enable less invasive surgeries. Magnetic tools, capsules, or medication can be controlled inside a human body using electromagnets. However, resistive magnetic devices able to produce strong magnetic fields in a large volume inefficiently use space and energy. This paper presents the design and testing of a magnetic manipulator cooled with liquid nitrogen. This technique reduces the electrical resistance of copper wires. It therefore reduces the amount of heat generated to produce a given magnetic field. Liquid nitrogen-cooled electromagnets are smaller than air-cooled ones and use less power. This paper examines how both effects scale with the size of the workspace. %therefore cheaper to build.  
The system presented possesses six electromagnets and its ability to control robots is demonstrated experimentally.
