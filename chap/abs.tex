In the field of robotics, there are various control systems utilized depending on the kind of robot being considered. This project presents three different robotic manipulators, and then compares their control systems. The first system is a cryogenic manipulation system. In this system, the robotic workspace is a 150mm3 cube, and the system implements a 3-dimensional control on the robot’s position and orientation. To obtain accurate results, and obtain higher torque without a solid Iron core, this system has all its coils cooled by liquid nitrogen to achieve a higher magnetic field without damaging the coils.  In the second system, a 2-directional position control method is implemented. This system is created to simulate wall contacts, and implement an algorithm for navigating magnetic robots in a cavity (2- dimensions in this case) given the constraints of the cavity’s geometry, and global inputs to the robots. The last system is a robotic manipulator created out of a toy robotic arm kit. The aim here was to increase the robot’s accuracy and augment its functionality, while making it userfriendly to students new to robotics.
