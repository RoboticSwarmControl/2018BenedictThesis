I would like to deeply thank the following people who played outstanding roles in the completion of this thesis. My immense gratitude goes to my indefatigable thesis committee chair, professor and mentor, Dr. Aaron T. Becker for his steadfast guidance, patience, encouragement and kindness while I was working on this thesis. I profoundly appreciate Dr. Julien Leclerc and Dr. Shiva Shahrokhi for their advice, directions, patience and coaching roles while I was working on their respective projects. I am extremely grateful to the various members of the swarm robotics lab for being there for me when I had issues and having no problems stepping in with explanations. Lastly, this note of acknowledgement would not be complete without recognizing my parents for their utter love, tireless encouragement and unswerving support.
